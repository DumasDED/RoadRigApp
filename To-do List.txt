- Fix material import errors:
    Boy, this was a big ol' bitch to solve. Here's the gist of it: whenever I would initially serve the app, it would throw a huge slew of errors to do with the angular material and various other node modules - in other words, things I had no control over. If I commented out the references to material, the app compiled successfully. If I then uncommented them out, the app compiled successfully again. In other words, it worked some of the time, but not all the time. This turned out to have everything to do with the various versions of dependencies I was dealing with, and after much ado with attempting to install and/or upgrade all the various packages my project was using I opted to just nuke the package.json file entirely, create a new one (npm init) and carefully reinstall all of the dependent packages one at a time, being careful to address peer dependencies as they came up until no more of them were displayed. By that point I'd also encountered a warning message to do with my typescript version being too far advanced, so I in fact had to downgrade to an earlier version in order to make the warning go away. In any case, the app now works completely fine, as expected, with no more errors on the initial serve. Moral of story: pay closer attention to package versions and peer dependencies whenever something gets installed.
- Add custom markers:
    Did this. Attempted to create some custom markers in Photoshop, which were just basic dots with some three-dimensional rounding to make them pop a bit more. They still don't look very good, but they serve the purpose for the time being. I've also made it so that markers change color when you hover over them.
